# 📡 Network Protocol Analysis using Wireshark

This repository contains a network packet capture (`.pcapng` file) and a short protocol analysis report generated using Wireshark. The goal is to observe and summarize the various network protocols used during the session.

---

## 📁 Deliverables

- `capture.pcapng` – Packet capture file generated using Wireshark.
- `protocol-summary-report.md` – Summary report of observed protocols and traffic patterns.
- `screenshots`
---

## 🧪 Tools Used

- **Wireshark**: Used to capture and analyze network traffic.

---

## 🔍 Protocols Identified

Protocols commonly observed in this capture include (but are not limited to):

- Ethernet (Layer 2)
- IPv4
- TCP
- DNS
- HTTP

Check the report file for a complete breakdown with packet counts and protocol hierarchy.

## 📝 How to View the Capture

1. Install [Wireshark](https://www.wireshark.org/download.html).
2. Open `capture.pcapng` in Wireshark.
3. Go to `Statistics → Protocol Hierarchy` for protocol breakdown.
4. Use filters (e.g., `tcp`, `dns`, `http`) to inspect specific traffic.
